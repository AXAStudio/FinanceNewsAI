Senteco AI is an AI-powered financial news sentiment analysis system.  
It uses a deep learning model (BiLSTM + TensorFlow) to process market news headlines in real time, returning structured sentiment scores for companies, tickers, and assets.

---

## Features

- **Finance-Specific Sentiment Model**  
  Trained on a large dataset of financial news headlines for bullish/bearish classification.

- **Live News Retrieval**  
  Pulls the latest headlines from Google News RSS, filtered by company name or ticker symbol.

- **Structured API Output**  
  Returns the average sentiment score, individual article scores, publication dates, sources, and links.

- **Robust Evaluation**  
  Uses Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure consistent model performance.

- **REST API Implementation**  
  Built with Flask and asyncio for low-latency, concurrent requests.

## Example Output

```json
{
  "asset_details": {
    "asset_name": "Amazon",
    "asset_ticker": "AMZN"
  },
  "n_articles_found": 10,
  "avg_score": 0.42,
  "oldest_article_read": "3 Days Ago",
  "data": {
    "0": {
      "headline": "Amazon shares rise after strong earnings report",
      "cover": "https://www.projectactionstar.com/uploads/videos/no_image.gif",
      "score": 0.87,
      "date": "Thu, 08 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT",
      "outlet": "Reuters",
      "article_links": "https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-earnings"
    }
  }
}
```
## Model Architecture

 - Text Preprocessing: TextVectorization layer

 - Embedding Layer: 64-dimensional embeddings

 - Recurrent Layer: Bidirectional LSTM (64 units)

 - Dense Layers: Fully connected with dropout for regularization

 - Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary sentiment classification

## Flow

Input → Vectorizer → Embedding(64) → BiLSTM(64) → Dense(64, relu) → Dense(1, sigmoid)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AXAStudio/senteco-ai.git
cd senteco-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the API
```bash
flask run
```
## Roadmap

 - Add Ticker based sentiment analysis
 - Support multi-language headline analysis
 - Support two options for models to run the api
   - Lightweight model
   - Heavyweight model
